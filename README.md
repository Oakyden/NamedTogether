# Named Together

A baby name selection app. Couples sign up, pair together and each shortlist names. Together, a shared shortlist is created

## Created with Claude

This app has mainly been a test of Claude code and how much can be achieved with minimal coding intervention. A schema / configuration via an initial CLAUDE.md file has been attempted to avoid too much prompt coding.

Backend logic and general app planning has been done by [Alan Oakden](https://github.com/oakyden)
